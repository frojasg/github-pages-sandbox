I build this repository to play a little bit with github pages.

# Roadmap
My Roadmap looks like something like this:

- [ ] As developer I want to generate beatiful looking documentation eforless so i can focus in the documentation
- [ ] As developer I want to have a build script to generate documentation automatically
- [ ] As Developer I want to update my documentation in github pages eforless. I don't want to manually push my generated html to the gh-branch


still I'm tourned, not sure if I should use gitbook or jekyll. So I guess this will be part of the sadbox ass well
